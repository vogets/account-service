# This is the kubernetes file for the account-service
# In the service section, as we want to keep this service accessible only inside the kubernetes cluster
# we have the option of using the NodePort, or ClusterIP. Remember that if you use LoadBalancer in a eks cluster
# a load balancer will be created in AWS, pointing to the node instances of the cluster, which means it will be externally reachable.
